# Who's taller?

Hi! thanks for checking out this repo!

This is the source code for <em>Who's taller?</em>, a guessing game that compares the heights of celebrities, historical and fictional characters. It is built with NextJS and MongoDB.

## About

The inspiration for this app came a long time ago, after playing [The Higher-Lower Game](http://www.higherlowergame.com/).

A first version of this app was written in early 2021: it was written in Python and was, quite honestly, a big mess. It was indeed my very first ever approach to web development.

_Want to see the difference? -> [Who's taller? - built with Flask](https://whostaller.herokuapp.com/)_

In the meantime, I've diven much deeper into frontend. I still thought the idea was pretty nice, so I decided to rewrite it with a more modern stack.
